# Movie Finder

Movie Finder is a Next.js application which enables chatting with any Movie Finder server with a `messages` key through a chat interface.

> [!NOTE]
> ðŸŽ¥ Watch the video setup guide [here](https://youtu.be/lInrwVnZ83o).

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the app:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the app is running (or if using the deployed site), you'll be prompted to enter:

- **Deployment URL**: The URL of the LangGraph server you want to chat with. This can be a production or development URL.
- **Assistant/Graph ID**: The name of the graph, or ID of the assistant to use when fetching, and submitting runs via the chat interface.
- **LangSmith API Key**: (only required for connecting to deployed LangGraph servers) Your LangSmith API key to use when authenticating requests sent to LangGraph servers.

After entering these values, click `Continue`. You'll then be redirected to a chat interface where you can start chatting with your LangGraph server.

## Environment Variables

You can bypass the initial setup form by setting the following environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:2024
NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_ID=agent
```

> [!TIP]
> If you want to connect to a production LangGraph server, read the [Going to Production](#going-to-production) section.

To use these variables:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`
2. Fill in the values in the `.env` file
3. Restart the application

When these environment variables are set, the application will use them instead of showing the setup form.
